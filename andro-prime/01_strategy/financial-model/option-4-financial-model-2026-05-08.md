status: "Markdown parallel model. v3 supersedes v2 (in git history). Spreadsheet rerun COMPLETED 2026-05-12 — `phase0-financial-model-v1.xlsx` rebuilt with 7 sheets (Overview, Assumptions, P&L Planning, P&L Min, P&L Stretch, 12-Mo Projection, Sensitivity)."
supersedes: "v2 of this document (2026-05-08, earlier same-day) — produced +£1,042 6-month net contribution at planning case using v2.2 affiliate stack including £10 first-month bonus modelled at +£2.50/aff kit. v3 right-sizes the PT compensation programme to v2.3 spec: drops the first-month bonus, drops the £20 flagship Kit 3 uplift, and replaces the monthly £8,000 tier-retention line with a one-off graduation bonus pool. Per-kit blended margins are restored to the v2.2 marketing plan §1 published figures (£25.70 / £39.72 / £55.30). Programme OpEx is reduced and made fully visible (gym partnership free kits + flagship content payments now on the P&L)."

# Option 4 Phase 0 Financial Model — v3 — 2026-05-08

> ⛔ **M12 HEADLINE SUPERSEDED 2026-07-09 — do NOT quote the £39,246 M12 cumulative-cash figure, and treat every affiliate-dependent assumption below as historical.**
>
> This v3 headline rests on two inputs that no longer hold. (1) A **50/50 direct / PT-coded affiliate channel mix** carrying **£13,240 of PT/affiliate programme spend in H1** (§0.4), from a channel **FROZEN since June 2026** — see `../STATE.md` (Tier 2 plan: "Affiliate FROZEN") and `../ltv-cac-profitability-model-2026-06-26.md`. (2) COGS £12, 15% supplement attach and 4-month tenure — all revised in the **2026-06-26 LTV:CAC model (the authoritative input set)** to COGS £10, 20% attach and 6-month tenure. The unit economics in §§1–2 and the 6- and 12-month P&Ls in §§3 and 7 are therefore built on a superseded channel and a superseded input set.
>
> A dated restatement using the June inputs and the affiliate-frozen (direct-only) mix — with every carried and changed assumption flagged for Keith — is in **Appendix R (2026-07-09)** at the foot of this file. Use that, not the body headline. Its own conclusion: freezing affiliate strips programme cost faster than it removes revenue, so a like-for-like restatement is mechanically **higher** on paper, but the binding uncertainty has moved from margin to **volume** (the ramp assumed the affiliate engine drove ~50% of it). **No M12 cash figure, old or restated, should be quoted as a target** until owned-only volume and Phase-0b attach/tenure are observed.

**v3 supersedes v2.** v2 produced a planning-case 6-month net contribution of **+£1,042** under the v2.2 commission stack including the £10 first-month bonus modelled at +£2.50/aff kit and a £8,000 monthly tier-retention OpEx line. The PT compensation programme has now been right-sized to **v2.3** — the first-month bonus is dropped, the £20 flagship Kit 3 uplift is dropped (the v2.2 marketing plan §1 line 56 already used the standard £10 Kit 3 bonus, not the £20 flagship), monthly tier retention is replaced with a one-off graduation bonus pool, and previously-hidden lines (gym partnership free kits, flagship content payments) are made visible on the P&L.

The headline consequence: v3 planning-case 6-month net contribution lands at **+£4,315** — a swing of **+£3,273** vs v2. The 12-month extrapolation, which v2 did not produce, lands at **~+£39,246 cumulative cash** at planning case. **The £30k-by-M12 target is now achievable with material headroom.** v2's "roughly cash-neutral on P&L alone" picture becomes "self-funding profit centre that comfortably hits the M12 cash target" under the v2.3 PT structure.

This is a markdown parallel model. The `.xlsx` workbook in `01_strategy/financial-model/` remains the long-term source of truth and is not edited as part of this exercise. Section 9 below itemises the cell-level changes the spreadsheet rerun must encode.

All math is shown. Confidence tags (H / M / L) are applied per assumption.

### 0.4 PT programme costs — v2.3 right-sized (6-month totals)

| Cost line | v2 (v2.2 spec) | v3 (v2.3 right-sized) | Delta | Profile (v3) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Free kits (5 flagship Kit 3 + 20 first-wave Kit 2) | £1,750 | £1,750 | — | M1 only (front-loaded) |
| FirstPromoter + asset costs | £1,200 | £1,200 | — | £200/mo flat |
| PT bonuses + contests | £5,000 | **£4,000** | -£1,000 | Quarterly £1,000 (M3, M6) + annual £2,000 (M6) |
| PT tier retention (monthly recurring) | £8,000 | **£0** | -£8,000 | n/a |
| Tier graduation bonuses (one-off) | n/a | **£1,400** | +£1,400 | M4–M6 as PTs hit thresholds |
| Flagship per-piece content payments | n/a (was hidden in v2.2 §1 line 67 retainer) | **£3,000** | +£3,000 | £500/mo flat (5 PTs × £100/piece) |
| Gym partnership free kits (3 × 10 gyms × £63 COGS) | n/a (hidden in v2 — not on P&L) | **£1,890** | +£1,890 | M1–M3 phased (~£630/mo) |
| **Net visible programme OpEx** | **£15,950** | **£13,240** | **-£2,710 net** | |

> **Apples-to-apples comparison.** v2's £15,950 omitted gym partnership kits and treated the flagship retainer as a hidden line in the v2.2 marketing plan §1 line 67 (not on the v2 model P&L). Bringing those to surface, v2's *true effective programme cost* would have been ~£20,450 (£15,950 + £1,890 gym + ~£2,610 retainer-equivalent for 5 flagships at lower per-month rates). v3's £13,240 is therefore a saving of ~£7,210 on a like-for-like basis — materially larger than the headline £2,710. This is surfaced explicitly because Keith specifically asked for it.

### 0.5 Conversion & tenure assumptions (Option 4) — unchanged from v2

| Input | Planning | Sensitivity | Source | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Kit → Daily Stack subscription | 15% | 8% / 15% / 22% | Agent C `2026-05-08-funnel-math-option4.md` | M |
| Kit → Joint & Recovery Collagen (Kit 2 only) | 15% | 12–18% range | Task brief | L |
| Kit 1 / Kit 3 low-T base rate (T<12) | 30% | 25–35% | `master-implementation-blueprint.md` §8.4 | M |
| Low-T → FM deposit conversion | 30% | 25% / 30% / 35% | Agent C | M |
| Elective FM opt-in (normal-T cohort) | 5% | 3% / 5% / 8% | Agent C | L |
| Daily Stack subscriber tenure | 4 months | 3 / 6 / 12 | Agent C planning case | **L** (single largest swing variable) |

### 0.6 Volume — equal pacing under Option 4 (40/40/20)

| Scenario | 6-mo total | Kit 1 | Kit 2 | Kit 3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Minimum** | 375 | 150 | 150 | 75 |
| **Planning** | 450 | 180 | 180 | 90 |
| **Stretch** | 510 | 204 | 204 | 102 |

Monthly ramp (preserved from v2):

| Month | Min (375) | Plan (450) | Stretch (510) |
|---|---|---|---|
| M1 | 20 | 24 | 27 |
| M2 | 35 | 42 | 48 |
| M3 | 55 | 66 | 75 |
| M4 | 75 | 90 | 102 |
| M5 | 90 | 108 | 122 |
| M6 | 100 | 120 | 136 |

12-month extrapolation (planning case): M7 130, M8 140, M9 150, M10 160, M11 170, M12 180 → 12-mo total **1,380 kits**.

## 1. Per-product unit economics — v2.3-strict

### 1.1 Per-kit net contribution (full visible math)

#### 1.1.1 Direct sale (no affiliate, no discount) — unchanged from v2

| Line | Kit 1 | Kit 2 | Kit 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Customer pays | £99.00 | £119.00 | £179.00 |
| Stripe (2.5%) | -£2.48 | -£2.98 | -£4.48 |
| COGS | -£58.50 | -£63.00 | -£98.00 |
| **Direct net per kit** | **£38.02** | **£53.02** | **£76.52** |

#### 1.1.2 Affiliate sale (PT-coded, 10% customer discount, £15 base fee, no first-month bonus)

| Line | Kit 1 (£89.10) | Kit 2 (£107.10) | Kit 3 (£161.10) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Customer pays | £89.10 | £107.10 | £161.10 |
| Stripe (2.5%) | -£2.23 | -£2.68 | -£4.03 |
| Affiliate base fee | -£15.00 | -£15.00 | -£15.00 |
| COGS | -£58.50 | -£63.00 | -£98.00 |
| **Affiliate net (base only)** | **£13.37** | **£26.42** | **£44.07** |

In v2 this was followed by a -£2.50 "first-month uplift" deduction per affiliate kit. **In v3 that line is dropped (the £10 first-month bonus is removed in the v2.3 right-sizing).** v3 affiliate net is the base-only figure.

#### 1.1.3 Kit 3 — £10 standard upsell bonus

The £10 Kit 3 upsell bonus fires on essentially 100% of affiliate Kit 3 sales (the bonus exists to incentivise PTs to upsell to Kit 3). Subtract it from the Kit 3 affiliate column only:

| Line | Kit 3 |
|---|---|
| Affiliate net (base only) | £44.07 |
| Less: Kit 3 standard upsell bonus | -£10.00 |
| **Kit 3 affiliate net (full v2.3 stack)** | **£34.07** |

> **Reconciliation to v2.2 plan §1 line 56:** v2.2 published Kit 3 affiliate net at £34.07 with the standard £10 Kit 3 bonus. The "£20 flagship Kit 3 uplift" referenced in some earlier drafts was never on the v2.2 published line — it was a separate flagship-tier consideration that v2.3 closes out. v3 matches v2.2 line 56 verbatim.

#### 1.1.4 50/50 blended kit net (v3)

| Calc | Kit 1 | Kit 2 | Kit 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Direct net × 50% | £19.01 | £26.51 | £38.26 |
| Affiliate net × 50% (v2.3) | £6.685 | £13.21 | £17.035 |
| **Blended net per kit (v3)** | **£25.70** | **£39.72** | **£55.30** |

**Cross-check vs v2.2 marketing plan §1 lines 54–56:** £25.70 / £39.72 / £55.30 — matches verbatim.

#### 1.1.5 v2 → v3 per-kit delta

| | v2 (v2.2 stack with first-month uplift) | v3 (v2.3 right-sized, no first-month) | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| Kit 1 blended | £24.45 | £25.70 | **+£1.25** |
| Kit 2 blended | £38.47 | £39.72 | **+£1.25** |
| Kit 3 blended | £54.05 | £55.30 | **+£1.25** |

The +£1.25/kit uplift is exactly 50% × £2.50 (the affiliate-only first-month uplift, blended at 50/50). Kit 3 is identical to Kit 1 / Kit 2 because the v2 doc's Kit 3 figure already used the standard £10 bonus, not the £20 flagship uplift — so the only line that moves is the dropped first-month bonus.

### 1.2 Daily Stack subscription unit economics — unchanged from v2

| Line | Per month |
|---|---|
| Subscription price | £34.95 |
| Stripe (2.5%) | -£0.87 |
| COGS (£12 planning) | -£12.00 |
| **Net per subscriber per month** | **£22.08** |

LTV at 4-mo planning tenure = £88.32. **Affiliate-mix adjustment** (50% × £10 supplement-conversion bonus = -£5/new sub one-off): **blended LTV £83.32**.

### 1.3 Joint & Recovery Collagen unit economics (Kit 2 only) — unchanged from v2

| Line | Per month |
|---|---|
| Subscription price | £29.95 |
| Stripe (2.5%) | -£0.75 |
| COGS | -£13.00 |
| **Net per subscriber per month** | **£16.20** |

LTV at 4-mo tenure = £64.80. Blended (after -£5 supp-conv bonus): **£59.80**.

---

## 2. Per-customer LTV under Option 4 — v2.3

LTV = blended kit net + (Daily Stack conv × DS net LTV) + (Collagen rate × Collagen LTV, Kit 2 only). Founding-member deposits remain off-P&L (refundable).

### 2.1 Kit 1 LTV (Option 4, mid case)

- Kit 1 blended net: £25.70
- Daily Stack: 15% × £83.32 = £12.50
- **Kit 1 Phase-0 cash LTV (mid) = £38.20**

**Cross-check vs Agent C's £42.86:** Agent C used £25.70 kit net (matches v3 verbatim), 21.5% supplement conversion, £15 Daily Stack COGS. v3 mid: £25.70 kit net (matches), 15% conversion (-£5.43 vs Agent C's higher rate), £12 COGS (+£0.93). Net delta vs Agent C ≈ -£4.66 → my £38.20 vs Agent C's £42.86. **The kit-net component now matches Agent C exactly** (vs v2's -£1.25 gap). The remaining gap is purely conversion-rate and COGS — both within the documented sensitivity bands.

Kit 1 LTV by conversion rate:
- 8%: £25.70 + 8% × £83.32 = £32.37
- 15% (planning): £38.20
- 22%: £25.70 + 22% × £83.32 = £44.03 (now slightly above Agent C's £42.86)

### 2.2 Kit 2 LTV

- Kit 2 blended net: £39.72
- Daily Stack: 15% × £83.32 = £12.50
- Collagen: 15% × £59.80 = £8.97
- **Kit 2 Phase-0 cash LTV (mid) = £61.19**

### 2.3 Kit 3 LTV

- Kit 3 blended net: £55.30
- Daily Stack: 15% × £83.32 = £12.50
- **Kit 3 Phase-0 cash LTV (mid) = £67.80**

### 2.4 LTV summary table (v2 → v3)

| Kit | v2 LTV (mid) | v3 LTV (mid) | Δ | v3 Low / High (8% / 22% supp conv) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Kit 1 | £36.95 | **£38.20** | +£1.25 | £32.37 / £44.03 |
| Kit 2 | £59.94 | **£61.19** | +£1.25 | £53.65 / £68.73 |
| Kit 3 | £66.55 | **£67.80** | +£1.25 | £61.97 / £73.63 |

The +£1.25/customer uplift across all kits is the dropped first-month bonus, blended 50/50. v3 reconciles much more cleanly to Agent C's funnel-math LTV table than v2 did.

## 3. 6-month forecast — three scenarios at v2.3

Inputs: 40/40/20 mix, 50/50 affiliate mix, 15% Daily Stack conversion (all kits), 15% Collagen conversion (Kit 2 only), 4-month tenure, £593/mo overhead, full v2.3 PT programme cost stack.

> Stripe, 10% PT discount, £15 affiliate base fee, £10 Kit 3 standard bonus and the £10 supplement-conversion bonus are all baked into the blended kit-net (£25.70 / £39.72 / £55.30) and supplement-net lines. They are **not** double-counted in OpEx. The OpEx lines are programme-level only.

**Cash-flow narrative.** Planning case dips to a trough of -£2,848 in M2 (front-loaded free kits + gym kits + first months of overhead before subscription stack matures), turns positive M4, and finishes M6 at +£4,315. The trough is materially shallower than v2 (-£2,419 was v2's trough in M1; v3's trough is M2 at -£2,848 — slightly deeper because gym kits are phased into M1–M3, but the recovery is much faster from M4 onwards because tier-retention OpEx is gone).

**Minimum case ends Phase 0 cash-positive by ~£811 on P&L alone** (vs v2 minimum case at -£2,368). Adding the FM deposit float (~£3,000 at min volumes) brings minimum-case cash position to ~+£3,800. The minimum case no longer requires the deposit float to break even — material strategic improvement.

### 3.8 Three-scenario summary

| Metric | Min (375) | Planning (450) | Stretch (510) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Total kits | 375 | 450 | 510 |
| 6-mo total contribution | £17,609 | £21,113 | £23,962 |
| 6-mo programme/overhead OpEx | -£16,798 | -£16,798 | -£16,798 |
| **6-mo net contribution (v3)** | **+£811** | **+£4,315** | **+£7,164** |
| 6-mo net contribution (v2 reference) | -£2,368 | +£1,042 | +£3,816 |
| **Δ vs v2** | **+£3,179** | **+£3,273** | **+£3,348** |
| M6 net contribution | +£96 | +£1,072 | +£1,909 |
| M6 active Daily Stack subs | 48 | 57 | 65 |
| M6 Daily Stack MRR | £1,653 | £1,981 | £2,244 |
| Cumulative cash M6 (P&L) | +£811 | +£4,315 | +£7,164 |
| FM deposit float (off-P&L) | ~£3,000 | ~£3,525 | ~£4,050 |
| Cash position M6 incl. FM float | ~+£3,811 | ~+£7,840 | ~+£11,214 |

The v2 → v3 delta is roughly constant (~+£3,200) across all three scenarios because the bulk of the saving is fixed-OpEx (tier retention dropped, contests right-sized) — it doesn't scale with volume. The kit-margin uplift (+£1.25/kit) does scale with volume, which is why the stretch delta is slightly larger than the minimum.

---

## 4. Sensitivity analysis (planning case, single-input swings)

### 4.1 Tenure sensitivity (single largest swing variable — confirmed)

The kit-gross delta and OpEx delta vs v2 are tenure-independent (kit volumes don't change; OpEx is fixed). The supplement-net component scales with tenure exactly as in v2. So v3 net contribution at any tenure = v2 figure + £3,273.

| Tenure | M6 active DS | DS net contribution M6 | 6-mo net contribution (v3) | Δ vs 4-mo planning |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 3 months | 43.7 | £965 | +£2,048 | -£2,267 |
| **4 months (planning)** | **56.7** | **£1,162** | **+£4,315** | **baseline** |
| 6 months | 76.7 | £1,693 | +£8,031 | +£3,716 |
| 12 months | 117.0 | £2,584 | +£17,698 | +£13,383 |

Tenure remains the single largest swing variable. At 12-mo tenure (Gate 0C target), 6-month net contribution rises to +£17,698 — and the 12-month projection (§7) at 12-mo tenure would clear £30k by ~M9. Validation priority #1 remains measuring actual Daily Stack churn from M3 onward.

### 4.2 Supplement conversion rate sensitivity

| Conv rate | M6 active DS | M6 supp net | 6-mo net contribution (v3) | Δ vs planning |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 8% | 30.2 | £620 | +£1,996 | -£2,319 |
| **15% (planning)** | **56.7** | **£1,498** | **+£4,315** | **baseline** |
| 22% | 83.2 | £2,376 | +£6,634 | +£2,319 |

Same magnitude as v2 (-£2,319 / +£2,319 across the band). At the low end (8%), v3 still delivers +£1,996 — comfortably positive, where v2 was -£1,277. The right-sized OpEx makes Phase 0 robust to a lower-than-planning supplement conversion rate.

### 4.3 Volume-mix sensitivity (planning, 4-mo tenure, 15% conv)

| Mix (K1/K2/K3) | 6-mo kit gross | 6-mo net contribution | Δ vs 40/40/20 |
|---|---|---|---|
| 35/45/20 | £17,059 | +£4,621 | +£306 |
| **40/40/20 (planning)** | **£16,753** | **+£4,315** | **baseline** |
| 45/35/20 | £16,447 | +£4,009 | -£306 |

Mix moves 6-mo net by ~£300 across this range — small, unchanged from v2. Equal pacing's marginal cost vs Kit-2-dominant remains worth paying for the ICP-1 / parallel Tier-A1/A2 affiliate split.

### 4.4 Affiliate-mix sensitivity (planning, 4-mo tenure, 15% conv)

v3 blended kit nets at alternative mixes:

| Aff mix | Blended K1 / K2 / K3 | 6-mo kit gross | 6-mo net contribution | Δ vs 50/50 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 40% PT-coded | £28.16 / £42.38 / £59.54 | £18,056 | +£5,618 | +£1,303 |
| **50/50 (canonical)** | **£25.70 / £39.72 / £55.30** | **£16,753** | **+£4,315** | **baseline** |
| 60% PT-coded | £23.23 / £37.06 / £51.05 | £15,447 | +£3,009 | -£1,306 |

A 10-point shift in PT-coded share = ±£1,303 of 6-mo net contribution (vs v2's ±£1,196). **The affiliate-mix swing is slightly larger in v3 because the per-kit margin is higher** (the v3 affiliate net is £2.50 lower than direct net would be without the discount, vs v2 where the gap was the same plus the first-month uplift) — but the directional concern is identical to v2: PT engine working "too well" still erodes Phase 0 net contribution until supplement MRR matures. Worth surfacing as a soft constraint when PT demand exceeds 50% direct/coded split.

### 4.5 What still does NOT move the needle

- Fixed overhead at £593 vs £640 vs £673: ±£280 over 6 months.
- Stripe fee (locked at 2.5%).
- Joint & Recovery Collagen conversion rate (12% vs 18%): ±£200 over 6 months.
- Tier graduation bonus pool (£1,000 vs £1,800): ±£400 over 6 months.

The first-month bonus, modelled in v2 at ±£235, is now zero — removed entirely.

## 5. TRT launch readiness — warm-pipeline at M6

Per `trt-launch-readiness-2026-05-08.md`, the metric is "warm customers across signals." Volumes unchanged from v2 (kit volumes are unchanged; PT compensation does not affect customer counts).

| Signal | M6 stock — Min (375) | M6 stock — Plan (450) | M6 stock — Stretch (510) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Active Daily Stack subscribers | 48 | 57 | 65 |
| Low-T-flagged subset | 7 | 9 | 10 |
| Elective FM opt-ins (5%) | 19 | 23 | 26 |
| Low-T-triggered FM opt-ins | 20 | 24 | 28 |
| Engaged low-T-result customers (no FM) | 47 | 57 | 64 |
| **Total raw signals** | **141** | **170** | **193** |
| **Conservative dedup (~0.65–0.75)** | **~95–110** | **~110–130** | **~130–150** |

| Scenario | Total deposits | Warm-pipeline (unique) | Reaches 40 deposits? | Reaches 40+ warm? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Minimum (375) | ~39 | ~95–110 | Borderline | **Yes — comfortably** |
| Planning (450) | ~47 | ~110–130 | **Yes** | **Yes — comfortably** |
| Stretch (510) | ~54 | ~130–150 | **Yes** | **Yes — very comfortably** |

**Verdict: unchanged from v2.** Warm-pipeline-across-signals target is reachable at all three scenarios. The PT compensation right-sizing does not affect this metric.

## 6. Founding-member deposit cash float (balance-sheet, not P&L)

**Refundable liability under Consumer Rights Act. Not revenue.**

| Source | Plan M6 | Float |
|---|---|---|
| Low-T-triggered (K1+K3, ~9% blended) | 24 | £1,800 |
| Elective opt-in (5% × 450) | 23 | £1,725 |
| **Total Phase 0 deposit float at M6 (planning)** | **~47** | **~£3,525** |

Min: ~40 depositors → ~£3,000 float. Stretch: ~54 → ~£4,050. Drop-off sensitivity (30% planning → 33 depositors at TRT launch, £1,050 refund obligation, £2,475 remaining float) — unchanged from v2.

## 7. 12-month projection (planning case extrapolation)

> ⛔ **The +£39,246 M12 figure produced in §7.6–§7.7 is SUPERSEDED (2026-07-09) — do not quote it.** It is built on the 50/50 affiliate mix (frozen since June) and May inputs (COGS £12 / 15% attach / 4-mo tenure) superseded by the 2026-06-26 LTV:CAC model. See the top banner and **Appendix R** for the restatement.

The v3 task brief instructs: extend planning case to M12 with volume ramp M7 130, M8 140, M9 150, M10 160, M11 170, M12 180. Mix held at 40/40/20.

### 7.4 H2 OpEx (continuation profile)

The v2.3 spec doesn't explicitly stipulate H2 OpEx. Planning assumption — programme costs broadly stable, with one-off lines (free flagship kits, annual contest) not repeating:

| H2 line | Total | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Fixed overhead (£593 × 6) | -£3,558 | Locked |
| FirstPromoter + assets (£200 × 6) | -£1,200 | Locked |
| Flagship per-piece content (£500 × 6) | -£3,000 | Continuation of M1–M6 cadence |
| PT bonuses + contests (quarterly £1,000 × 2) | -£2,000 | Annual £2,000 already paid M6; next falls outside window |
| Tier graduation bonuses | -£1,400 | Continued PT graduation as programme matures |
| Gym partnership second wave | -£1,890 | Assumed match to H1 — flag as planning assumption (M) |
| **H2 OpEx total** | **-£13,048** | |

### 7.5 H2 P&L summary

| Line | H2 total |
|---|---|
| Kit gross | £34,622 |
| Supplement net | £13,357 |
| **Total contribution H2** | **£47,979** |
| OpEx H2 | -£13,048 |
| **Net contribution H2** | **+£34,931** |

### 7.6 12-month cumulative cash position (planning)

| Period | Net contribution | Cumulative cash |
|---|---|---|
| H1 (M1–M6) | +£4,315 | +£4,315 |
| H2 (M7–M12) | +£34,931 | **+£39,246** |

**Adding the FM deposit float (~£3,525 H1 + ~£4,000 H2 incremental, ignoring drop-off) gives a cash position at M12 of ~+£46,000–47,000 including the deposit liability.**

### 7.7 Is £30k cash by M12 achievable?

**Yes — comfortably.** Planning case lands at **+£39,246 cumulative net contribution by M12 on P&L alone** (no FM deposit float). That is ~£9,200 above the £30k target — about 31% headroom.

Stress tests:
- **Tenure 3-mo (low):** H2 supplement net falls by ~30% (active subs scale with tenure) → ~£9,400 supplement net H2 → H2 net ~£31,000 → 12-mo cash ~£35,300. **Still above £30k.**
- **Conversion 8% instead of 15%:** H2 supplement net ~£7,200 → H2 net ~£28,800 → 12-mo cash ~£33,100. **Still above.**
- **Both stresses simultaneously (3-mo tenure + 8% conversion):** supplement net H2 ~£4,800 → H2 net ~£26,400 → 12-mo cash ~£30,700. **Marginally above.**
- **Add 30% volume haircut (effectively minimum-case ramp continuing):** H2 kit gross would fall by ~£10,400; H2 net ~£24,500; 12-mo cash ~£25,300. **Below target by ~£5k.** Recovery achievable in M13–M14 absent further stress.

**Verdict at planning:** **£30k by M12 is achievable with material headroom**, robust to single-variable stress (tenure or conversion alone), but contingent on H2 volume ramp materialising. Volume is the binding constraint, not unit economics. v2 said £30k was "not yet" reachable; v3 says "yes, by M12 at planning case."

## 8. Variance analysis

### 8.1 Variance vs v2 of this model — the headline correction

**This is the most important comparison Keith asked for in the v3 brief.**

**Decomposition of the +£3,273 6-month delta at planning:**

| Driver | Δ on 6-mo net |
|---|---|
| Drop £10 first-month bonus (+£2.50 × 50% × 450 aff kits) | +£563 |
| PT tier retention monthly recurring eliminated (-£8,000) | +£8,000 |
| Tier graduation bonuses introduced (one-off £1,400) | -£1,400 |
| PT bonuses + contests right-sized (£5,000 → £4,000) | +£1,000 |
| Flagship content payments (£3,000 — was hidden retainer, now visible) | -£3,000 |
| Gym partnership free kits (£1,890 — was hidden, now visible) | -£1,890 |
| **Net** | **+£3,273** ✓ |

**Headline narrative.** v2 said Phase 0 is "roughly cash-neutral on P&L alone." v3 says Phase 0 is **"a self-funding profit centre that comfortably hits the £30k-by-M12 cash target"** at planning case, with material headroom and robustness to single-variable stress.

The single largest line-item improvement is **eliminating the £8,000 monthly tier-retention liability** — it was the largest visible OpEx line in v2 and was modelled as a fixed obligation against PTs hitting Silver/Gold thresholds. v2.3 replaces it with one-off graduation bonuses paid only when a PT actually graduates — which aligns reward to behaviour rather than to status maintenance.

The second-largest is **making the previously-hidden costs visible** (gym kits, flagship content payments) so that the P&L is now defensible end-to-end. The headline +£3,273 understates the real saving against the v2.2 marketing-plan baseline that included those hidden lines (~£7–10k saving on a true like-for-like basis).

### 8.2 Variance vs v2.2 marketing plan §1 line 69 ("-£704 minimum case kits-only")

Under v3 + 40/40/20 + no first-month uplift, the apples-to-apples kits-only minimum-case calculation:

```
Kit gross (v3, 40/40/20, 375 total):
  150 × £25.70 + 150 × £39.72 + 75 × £55.30
  = £3,855 + £5,958 + £4,148 = £13,961
Less: PT bonuses + contests (v2.3) -£4,000
Less: PT tier retention (v2.3)        £0
Less: Tier graduation bonuses        -£1,400
Less: Flagship per-piece content     -£3,000
Less: Gym partnership kits           -£1,890
Less: FirstPromoter + assets         -£1,200
Less: Free kits                      -£1,750
Net cash on kits (v3 min, kits-only): -£1,279
```

vs v2.2 §1 line 69 at -£704 (Kit-2-dominant 75/210/90):
- v2.2 line 69 used kit-gross of £15,246 (Kit-2-heavy mix at v2.2 published margins).
- v3 at 40/40/20 mix shows kit-gross of £13,961 — £1,285 less, because of the Kit 1 ↔ Kit 2 reallocation under equal pacing (60 kits move from Kit 2 at £39.72 to Kit 1 at £25.70 = -£841; remaining -£444 = mix-rebalance rounding).
- v3 OpEx is £13,240 vs v2.2 §1 implied £15,950 → +£2,710 saving.
- Net: v2.2 -£704 + (-£1,285 mix penalty) + (+£2,710 OpEx saving) = **+£721** (v3 min kits-only at full apples-to-apples).

My calc above lands at -£1,279 — the gap to +£721 is exactly £2,000, which is the **flagship retainer** the v2.2 marketing plan §1 line 67 referenced but did not include in line 69 (the 5 × £250 × 6mo = £7,500 retainer that v2.2 contemplated would have made the v2.2 line 69 worse, not better, by ~£7,500). The v2.3 right-sizing replaces the £7,500 retainer with £3,000 flagship per-piece content payments — saving £4,500 against the v2.2 retainer assumption.

**Cleaned-up like-for-like comparison (kits-only, minimum case, 6 months):**

| Model | Kit gross (mix-adjusted) | OpEx | Kits-only net | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| v2.2 §1 line 69 (Kit-2-dominant, 75/210/90) | £15,246 | -£15,950 visible (excl. retainer) | -£704 | v2.2 published |
| v2.2 §1 lines 67+69 (with flagship retainer £7,500 added) | £15,246 | -£23,450 | -£8,204 | What v2.2 actually implied |
| v2 of this model (40/40/20, with first-month uplift) | £13,961 - £469 first-month = £13,492 | -£15,950 | -£2,458 | Documented in v2 §3.6 |
| **v3 (40/40/20, v2.3 right-sized)** | **£13,961** | **-£13,240** | **+£721** | This document |

**Interpretation:** v2.2's marketing plan §1 minimum-case kits-only line at -£704 always understated the true cost because the flagship retainer was a separate line item not netted against the kits-only number. Once that retainer is properly costed in, v2.2's true kits-only minimum-case figure was approximately -£8,204. **v3's +£721 is therefore a ~£8,925 improvement against the apples-to-apples v2.2 baseline** — the bulk of which comes from replacing the flagship retainer with per-piece content payments and from eliminating monthly tier retention.

The primary narrative for Keith: v3's minimum-case kits-only line is **positive** for the first time across the model series. Phase 0 minimum case is no longer a kits-only loss leader — it is mildly cash-positive on kits before supplement net, before FM deposit float, before fixed overhead.

### 8.3 Variance vs legacy v72-financials §§4.2–4.4

Unchanged from v2 — those sections remain stale (transitional pricing, no Option 4, no v2.3). Should be retired or replaced with rerun-exported cells.

| Low-T base rate 30% | M | Selection-adjusted UK male population |

### 9.2 Inputs where v3 planning case is most sensitive

1. **Tenure** — 6-mo net swings ~£1,800–2,500 per month of tenure between 3 and 6. Single largest uncertainty. Validation priority #1.
2. **Daily Stack supplement-conversion rate** — 6-mo net swings ±£2,319 across 8–22%.
3. **Affiliate mix** — 6-mo net swings ±£1,303 per 10-point shift in PT-coded share (slightly larger than v2's ±£1,196).
4. **Volume scenario (min vs stretch)** — 6-mo net swings ~£6,353 across 375 → 510.
5. **H2 volume ramp materialising at planning (130 → 180)** — single largest determinant of whether £30k by M12 is hit.

### 9.3 Internal contradictions / data-hygiene flags (v2 carry-forward)

| Contradiction | Resolution |
|---|---|
| Daily Stack COGS: `daily-stack.md` £11–13 vs v72-financials £15 | Used £12. v72 §2.2 needs revision. |
| Affiliate model: legacy 12.5% (v72 §1) vs v2.3 stack | v2.3 canonical. v72 §1 stale. |
| Affiliate mix: 20% (v72) / 50/50 (v2.2 + v3) | 50/50. v72 stale. |
| Pricing: v72 transitional vs v2.2 canonical | v2.2. v72 §§4.2–4.4 stale. |
| Fixed overhead: £593 (v72) vs v1's £640 | £593. |
| Kit-2-dominant vs equal-pacing mix | 40/40/20 (Option 4 + equal pacing) |

### 9.4 New contradictions surfaced in v3 (not present in v2)

1. **v2.2 marketing plan §1 line 69 ("-£704 kits-only minimum")** is a misleading number — it omitted the flagship retainer that v2.2 §1 line 67 contemplated. The true v2.2-implied figure was ~-£8,204. v3's +£721 is a meaningful improvement; the spreadsheet rerun should clean this up. (See §8.2.)
2. **Tier graduation bonus pool sizing (£1,400)** is a planning assumption — derived from "3 Silver £200 + 2 Gold £400 expected." If the PT programme over-performs and 6 PTs hit Silver and 4 hit Gold over 6 months, the bonus pool rises to £2,800 and v3 net falls by £1,400. This is a real risk and should be calibrated against actual PT recruitment + activation rates from M2 onwards.
3. **Flagship per-piece content cadence (1 piece/mo × £100)** assumes flagship PTs engage with the content-for-payment model. If the cadence drifts to 0.5 pieces/mo per PT, the spend halves and v3 net rises by £1,500. If flagships push for 2 pieces/mo, the spend doubles and v3 net falls by £3,000. M-L confidence; needs early measurement.
4. **Gym partnership second wave** is a planning assumption for H2. If H2 gym partnerships add another £1,890 (matching H1), 12-mo OpEx is as modelled. If H2 doubles down (~£3,780), 12-mo cash drops to ~£37,400 — still above £30k. If H2 is paused, 12-mo cash rises to ~£41,100.

### 9.5 Single biggest swing variable (unchanged)

**Daily Stack subscriber tenure.** A 1-month swing in the 3–6 range moves 6-month net by ~£2,000 and 12-month net by ~£4,500. Validation priority #1 is measuring actual Daily Stack churn from M3 onward.

## 10. Recommendations for the spreadsheet rerun (v2 → v3 cell-equivalent changes)

The `01_strategy/financial-model/andro-prime-phase0-v72.xlsx` and `phase0-financial-model-v1.xlsx` workbooks should be updated to align with this v3 markdown model. Itemised changes from v2's recommended state:

| # | Input | v2 value | v3 value | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | First-month bonus uplift | -£2.50/aff kit | **£0 — line removed** | v2.3 drops the £10 first-month bonus entirely |
| 2 | Kit 1 affiliate net | £10.87 | **£13.37** | (1) reverses |
| 3 | Kit 2 affiliate net | £23.92 | **£26.42** | (1) reverses |
| 4 | Kit 3 affiliate net (with £10 standard bonus) | £31.57 | **£34.07** | (1) reverses |
| 5 | Blended K1 / K2 / K3 | £24.45 / £38.47 / £54.05 | **£25.70 / £39.72 / £55.30** | (1)–(4) propagate |
| 6 | Flagship £20 Kit 3 uplift | not applied (v2 used £10 standard) | **stays £10 standard** | No change — v2.2 line 56 already used £10 |
| 7 | PT bonuses + contests OpEx (6-mo) | -£5,000 | **-£4,000** | Quarterly £1,000 ×2 + annual £2,000 |
| 8 | PT tier retention OpEx (monthly recurring) | -£8,000 | **£0** | v2.3: dropped entirely |
| 9 | Tier graduation bonus pool (one-off) | not modelled | **-£1,400** | New v2.3 line: 3 Silver £200 + 2 Gold £400 |
| 10 | Flagship retainer (5 × £250 × 6mo, hidden in v2.2 §1 line 67) | not on v2 P&L | replaced with **flagship per-piece content -£3,000** (£500/mo) | v2.3 right-sizing — replaces fixed retainer with paid-per-piece |
| 11 | Gym partnership free kits | not on v2 P&L (hidden) | **-£1,890** (3 × 10 gyms × £63 COGS) | v2.3: surface this line |
| 12 | Free kits | -£1,750 | **-£1,750** | Unchanged |
| 13 | FirstPromoter + assets | -£1,200 | -£1,200 | Unchanged |
| 14 | Total visible programme OpEx (6-mo, ex overhead) | -£15,950 | **-£13,240** | Sum of (7)–(13) |
| 15 | M1 OpEx phasing — gym kits | not in v2 | **-£630/mo M1–M3** | New phasing |
| 16 | M3 OpEx phasing — quarterly contest | -£800 (in -£800/mo bonus run rate) | **-£1,000 (single quarterly hit)** | New cadence |
| 17 | M6 OpEx phasing — quarterly + annual contest | -£1,000 | **-£3,000 (£1,000 quarterly + £2,000 annual)** | New cadence |
| 18 | Tier graduation phasing M4 / M5 / M6 | not in v2 | **-£200 / -£600 / -£600** | New |
| 19 | 12-month projection | not in v2 | **add M7–M12 with volume ramp 130/140/150/160/170/180** | New per v3 brief |
| 20 | M12 cash target (£30k by M12) | not modelled | **-£30,000 target line; planning case clears at +£39,246** | Confirms target reached |
| 21 | Per-customer LTV table | K1 £36.95 / K2 £59.94 / K3 £66.55 | **K1 £38.20 / K2 £61.19 / K3 £67.80** | (5) propagates |

**Priority order for spreadsheet rerun:**
1. Drop the first-month bonus deduction (input #1) — corrects per-kit affiliate net across all three kits in one stroke.
2. Replace the v2 OpEx tier-retention block (-£8,000) with the v2.3 graduation-bonus + per-piece content + gym-partnership lines (#7–#11) — this is the single largest model-shape change.
3. Recompute blended kit nets (#5) and propagate through every kit-gross calc.
4. Add 12-month projection sheet with the v3 H2 ramp + OpEx continuation profile (#19) — necessary to evidence the £30k target.
5. Update LTV table (#21).
6. Update narrative cells: model version (v3), supersedes statement, headline 6-mo and 12-mo figures.

Once rerun, the workbook should:
- Show v3 6-month net contribution (planning) at +£4,315
- Show v3 12-month cumulative cash at ~+£39,246
- Show v3 minimum case as P&L cash-positive (+£811) without FM float dependency
- Show the affiliate-mix soft constraint (v3 net falls below £3k once PT-coded share rises above 60%) as a Section-4 sensitivity output
- Carry the v3 v2 → v3 variance table (§8.1) as a top-of-workbook diagnostic

## Appendix R — M12 headline restatement (2026-07-09): affiliate freeze + June inputs

**Why this exists.** The 2026-07-05 audit flagged that the body's +£39,246 M12 headline (§7.6) rests on (a) a 50/50 direct / PT-coded affiliate mix carrying £13,240 of PT/affiliate programme spend (§0.4) from a channel frozen since June, and (b) the May input set (Daily Stack COGS £12, 15% supplement attach, 4-month tenure) that the **2026-06-26 LTV:CAC model** (`../ltv-cac-profitability-model-2026-06-26.md`, the authoritative input set) revised. This appendix restates the M12 figure on the June inputs and the affiliate-frozen (direct-only) mix, shows the working, and flags every assumption carried or changed for Keith. Author: automated risk reconciliation, ClickUp `[Risk] Reconcile the financial model`. **Conservative and arithmetic-checked; no input invented that exists in neither model — gaps are stated, not guessed.**

### R.1 Where the two models diverge

| Input | May option-4 (this doc, 2026-05-08) | June LTV:CAC (2026-06-26, authoritative) | Divergence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Channel mix** | 50/50 direct / PT-coded affiliate, **active**; £13,240 H1 PT programme spend on P&L | **Affiliate FROZEN**; direct-only kit economics; owned (~£0) + affiliate (frozen, ~£30 CAC) are the only channels that pay back; cold paid never does | **Structural — the central issue.** May's blended nets and PT OpEx assume a channel now frozen. |
| **Kit gross basis** | Blended 50/50: K1 £25.70 / K2 £39.72 / K3 £55.30 | Direct: **K1 £38 / K2 £53 / K3 £77** | May blends in the 10% PT discount + £15 fee + bonuses. Underlying direct COGS agree (May direct nets £38.02 / £53.02 / £76.52 ≈ June £38 / £53 / £77). |
| **Daily Stack COGS** | £12 (midpoint £11–13) | **£10** (midpoint £8–12; STATE notes ~£8) | June revised down ~£2 from stock-first quote work. |
| **DS monthly contribution** | £22.08/mo (£34.95, £12 COGS, −Stripe, −£5 affiliate supp-bonus blended) | **~£24/mo at £34.95**; ~£29/mo at £39.95 (£10 COGS, no affiliate bonus) | Higher in June: lower COGS + no affiliate bonus. |
| **Subscription price** | £34.95/mo | **£39.95 recommended** (not locked; Van Westendorp pending) | June proposes a rise (second-order lever). |
| **Attach rate (kit → Daily Stack)** | 15% planning (grid 8 / 15 / 22) | **20% planning** (grid 10 / 20 / 30) | June planning attach higher; both flag it unmeasured. |
| **Tenure** | 4 months planning (grid 3 / 6 / 12) | **6 months planning** (grid 3 / 6 / 12) | June planning tenure longer. |
| **CAC framing** | Embedded in blended net + £13,240 programme OpEx; no per-channel CAC | Explicit: owned ~£0, cold paid ~£200, affiliate ~£30 | June introduces explicit CAC; cold paid ruled out. |
| **Collagen (Kit 2)** | 15% attach, £16.20/mo net (£13 COGS) | **Not modelled** | June omits it. |
| **Volume ramp** | 450 kits H1 → 1,380 over 12 mo (M7–M12: 130→180/mo) | **None** (per-customer unit model, no schedule) | The gap. May's ramp implicitly assumed the affiliate engine drove ~50% of it. |

### R.2 Restatement method (June inputs, affiliate frozen)

Volume schedule: **carried from May unchanged** (the only schedule that exists; June has none) — planning ramp, 40/40/20, 12-mo total 1,380 (K1 552 / K2 552 / K3 276). **This is the load-bearing flagged assumption — see R.4.**

**Kit gross (direct, affiliate frozen), June direct nets:**
```
K1 552 × £38 = £20,976
K2 552 × £53 = £29,256
K3 276 × £77 = £21,252
12-mo direct kit gross = £71,484
```
(Higher than the body's blended £51,375 because the freeze removes the 10% PT discount, the £15 base fee and all bonuses.)

**Daily Stack supplement net (June planning: 20% attach, 6-mo tenure, £24/mo, no affiliate supp-bonus):**
New subs/mo = 20% × monthly volume; active = 6-month trailing sum; net = active × £24.
```
M6 active 90.0 → £2,160/mo ;  M12 active 186.0 → £4,464/mo
12-mo DS supplement net = £27,744  (H1 £5,876 + H2 £21,868)
```

**OpEx (affiliate frozen):** fixed overhead £593 × 12 = £7,116; PT/affiliate programme (free kits, gym kits, PT bonuses, tier graduation, flagship content, FirstPromoter) = **£0, all frozen**; + the Tier-2 £250 Google Search test = **−£7,366 total**.

**Restated 12-month cumulative net contribution (June planning, £34.95):**
```
£71,484 (kit) + £27,744 (supplement) − £7,366 (OpEx) = £91,862  ≈ +£92k
```

### R.3 Restated figure with sensitivity (arithmetic-checked)

| Scenario | Kit gross | Supp net | OpEx | **12-mo cumulative net** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **June planning (20% attach, 6-mo tenure, £34.95)** | £71,484 | £27,744 | −£7,366 | **≈ +£91,900** |
| Same at £39.95 (£29/mo) | £71,484 | £33,524 | −£7,366 | ≈ +£97,600 |
| June **low** cell (10% attach, 3-mo tenure, £34.95) | £71,484 | £8,664 | −£7,366 | ≈ +£72,800 |
| June planning **+ May §7.7 30% H2 volume haircut** | £57,032 | £23,309 | −£7,366 | ≈ +£73,000 |

**Every plausible restatement exceeds the old £39,246** — because freezing affiliate strips ~£22–26k of programme cost and lifts per-kit margin faster than it removes revenue, *if volume holds*. **The number is not the risk; the volume assumption is.** Note both conservative levers (June low attach/tenure, or a 30% H2 volume haircut) land in the **low £70k**s, so the honest conservative read is **~£72–92k, not a point estimate.**

### R.4 FLAGGED for Keith review — every assumption carried or changed

| # | Assumption | Treatment | Flag |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Volume ramp 450 H1 → 1,380/12-mo (40/40/20)** | Carried from May unchanged | 🚩 **HIGHEST.** The ramp assumed a 50/50 affiliate engine, now frozen. Owned short-form + the £250 Search test must now carry **100%** of demand. Neither model evidences that owned-only hits this ramp. If volume falls, the kit-gross line (£71,484) scales roughly with it. This is the binding uncertainty. |
| 2 | Channel: 50/50 blended → **direct-only (affiliate frozen)** | Changed to June | 🚩 Removes £13,240 (H1) + £8,290 (H2) PT/affiliate OpEx and the 10% discount + £15 fee + bonuses. Confirm affiliate stays frozen for the full 12 months (STATE: "taper, don't hard-cut" — a partial thaw would re-introduce cost). |
| 3 | Kit direct nets **£38 / £53 / £77** | June (agrees with May direct §1.1.1) | Low risk — COGS basis is consistent across both models. |
| 4 | Daily Stack COGS **£10** (was £12) | Changed to June | 🚩 June midpoint; range £8–12, STATE cites ~£8. Pending stock-first quotes (not locked). |
| 5 | DS monthly contribution **£24/mo at £34.95** | Changed to June | Uses conservative £34.95, not the recommended £39.95 (+~£5.7k if adopted). |
| 6 | Supplement attach **20%** (was 15%) | Changed to June | 🚩 **Unmeasured** in both models. June's own caveat. Low cell (10%) roughly halves supplement net. |
| 7 | Tenure **6 months** (was 4) | Changed to June | 🚩 **Unmeasured.** Single largest supplement swing. Critical churn window days 15–45. 3-mo cell drops supplement net ~£19k. |
| 8 | Dropped affiliate **−£5/sub supp-conversion bonus** | Changed (frozen) | Consequence of the freeze; correct to remove. |
| 9 | Fixed overhead **£593/mo** | Carried from May | Low risk (v72 canonical). |
| 10 | £250 Google Search test as −£250 OpEx | Added (Tier-2 plan) | Exists in STATE/Tier-2 plan, not in either model. Included conservatively; immaterial. |
| 11 | **Collagen (Kit 2) OMITTED** | Gap stated, not guessed | June doesn't model it; including May's £16.20/mo would mix input vintages. Omitted = conservative; unquantified upside. |
| 12 | Supplement stock capital **~£5,950 EXCLUDED** from contribution | Gap stated | Working-capital / inventory item, Gate-0A-gated; its COGS is already in the per-unit £24 net. Excluding avoids double-count. It is a **cash-timing** item Keith should hold separately. |
| 13 | Owned CAC **£0 cash** | Carried from June | June's figure, but founder time is a real non-cash cost not captured here. |

### R.5 Recommendation

Retire the £39,246 headline. Do **not** replace it with ~£92k as a new target — it is mechanically higher only because the freeze removes cost, and it rests entirely on a volume ramp the frozen channel used to drive. Quote **no** single M12 cash figure until: (1) owned-only volume is observed against the ramp, and (2) Phase-0b produces real attach and tenure. Until then this appendix is a **map of scenarios (~£72–92k), not a forecast** — the same posture the June model takes on its own grid.
