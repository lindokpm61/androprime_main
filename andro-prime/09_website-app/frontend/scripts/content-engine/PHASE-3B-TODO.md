# Content Engine — Phase 3b TODO

Working checklist for the remaining autonomous-pipeline build. Phases 1, 2, 3a and the
3b **Signoff-Concierge** are done/merged (`8b3a26d`). Stages below refer to
`content_pipeline.stage`; gates are the human stops (G1 Keith, G2 Ewa, G3 re-opt).

Pipeline:
`keyword_selected → briefed → brief_ready → drafted → in_review → approved → scheduled → published → reoptimising`

Built so far: **Draft-Writer** (`brief_ready → drafted`) + **Signoff-Concierge** (`drafted → in_review`) + **orchestrator** (`in_review → approved → published`). The orchestrator tick now runs draft-writer → signoff-concierge → syncApprovals → publishDue.

---

## A. Close the loop end-to-end (highest leverage)

- [x] **Draft-Writer** — `brief_ready → drafted`. DONE. Deterministic **ingest** of an
  `/article`-produced MDX draft (authorship stays in `/article`: LLM + human source/voice/
  compliance judgement is not run headless). Derives the draft path from `brief_ref`
  (`…/article-briefs/X.md → …/article-drafts/X.mdx`), pre-gates (no unknown MDX components,
  no unresolved citation placeholders; full real-render gate still runs in the concierge),
  `upsert_blog_article(status='draft', editor='draft-writer')`, flips `stage='drafted'`.
  Idempotent, `--dry`, wired as tick step 0. E2E-verified (brief_ready → drafted, revision +
  article_id + agent_runs; idempotent re-tick). `draft-writer.ts`.
- [~] **Schedule the daily tick in a cloud runtime** — workflow DONE, pending secrets.
  `.github/workflows/content-engine.yml`: GitHub Actions, daily `cron '0 7 * * *'` +
  manual `workflow_dispatch` (with a `dry_run` toggle), concurrency-guarded, checks out the
  repo (Draft-Writer needs `article-drafts/*.mdx`), `npm ci` in frontend, runs
  `orchestrator.ts`. **Chose GitHub Actions** over Supabase Edge (a Deno fn can't read the
  repo's draft files) and over Coolify (engine isn't part of the Next deploy).
  **Remaining (ops, your side):** add repo secrets `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`,
  `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `CLICKUP_API_TOKEN`, `REVALIDATE_SECRET`, `PREVIEW_SECRET`
  (optional `CONTENT_ENGINE_BASE_URL`, defaults to prod); rotate the ClickUp token first;
  then run the workflow with `dry_run=true` to verify before the first live tick.
- [ ] **Rotate `CLICKUP_API_TOKEN`** — shared in chat 2026-06-19. Do regardless of the rest.

## B. Automate the top of the funnel

- [x] **Brief-Architect** — DONE (thin, as scoped). `brief-architect.ts`, two parts:
  **scaffold** (`keyword_queue 'accepted' & unbriefed → briefed`) writes the 21-section brief
  SKELETON file + a pipeline row parked on **Keith (G1)** + marks the queue row briefed —
  LOCAL/manual (writes a repo file); the strategic briefing itself stays human+LLM, not headless.
  **promote** (`briefed → brief_ready`) advances once the brief frontmatter says
  `status: brief-ready` AND no scaffold placeholders remain — read-only, **wired into the daily
  tick** (step 0). E2E-verified through both gates (pending → blocked-on-placeholders → promoted).
- [x] **Keyword-Scout** — DONE. `keyword-scout.ts`. Expands `--seed` phrases via the existing
  `tools/dataforseo.mjs` (single source of DFS truth; `suggest`/`related`/`overview`), filters by
  `--min-vol`/`--max-kd`, drops **clinical/regulated** terms (TRT/HRT/prescription/peptide/GLP-1 etc.
  — CLAUDE.md guardrail 2) and anything already in `keyword_queue` or `keywords.csv`, inserts
  survivors as `status='candidate'`. **MANUAL/periodic, not on the daily cron** (DFS is pay-per-call;
  candidate→accepted stays a human gate). `--dry` + `--from-json` (zero-spend test path). E2E-verified
  (every drop reason; live insert; idempotent re-run; DFS creds confirmed via `balance`).

## C. Measurement + ops hygiene

- [x] **Weekly digest** — DONE. `digest.ts` reads `agent_runs` (last 7d) + `content_pipeline`,
  leads with "N errored / M blocked", lists the actual error/blocked rows, the stage
  distribution, what's parked on each gate (Ewa/Keith), and what published this window.
  Output → stdout + the GitHub Actions job summary. Weekly workflow
  `.github/workflows/content-engine-digest.yml` (Mon 08:00 UTC + dispatch). Read-only, list
  caps logged not silent. E2E-verified (failure/parked branches render). `--days N` override.
- [ ] **Measurement-Analyst** — `published →` rankings / AI-citations / conversions from
  GSC + GA4. Gated on GSC data maturity (**~July**).
- [x] **Retire the n8n content-review path** — DONE. Deleted
  `automations/n8n/workflows/content-review-trigger.json`; n8n README updated (inventory,
  config/credential rows, runbook §1, blockers) to mark it retired → orchestrator owns it.

*Order = build A first (closes the loop), then B (fills the funnel), then C (measures it).*
